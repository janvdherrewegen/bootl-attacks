# GIAnT FPGA

Run the `dl_firm.sh` to download the GIAnT firmware and bitstream to the Zilinx FPGA. FWLoader and FWLoader.jar are available form the official [Ztex](https://www.ztex.de/downloads/#firmware_kit) repository (taken from release 181105). We have included the bitstream and firmware for both the series 1 and series 2 versions of the Xilinx FPGA. 

- ```main_series1.bit``` & ```uc_series1.ihx```: for the [ZTEX USB-FPGA Module 1.11](https://www.ztex.de/usb-fpga-1/usb-fpga-1.11.e.html) as used on the original GIAnT
- ```main_series2.bit``` & ```uc_series2.ihx```: for the alternative composition with the [USB-FPGA Module 2.04](https://www.ztex.de/usb-fpga-2/usb-fpga-2.04.e.html)
